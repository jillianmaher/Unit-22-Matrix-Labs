# Matrix Labs
The following labs will utilize common ArrayList methods and algorithms

## Lab Goals
Students will 
- represent a collection of related data using an two-dimensional (2D) array object
- traverse a 2D array using nested `for` loops
- identify and develop standard 2D array algorithms that require traversing


## Lab Files
The following lab files should be used together to complete the labs. Use the given section on the `Main.java` file to test any of your labs

** TicTacToe Board ** uses `TicTacToe.md` and `TicTacToe.java`
** MagicSquare Checker ** uses `MagicSquare.md` and `MagicSquare1.java`

EXTENSION: The following lab is above and beyond the suggested labs

** Kitty Map Filled ** uses `KittyMap.md` and `KittyMap.java`
